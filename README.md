My Favourite is the first project i've executed following my adventure with web development- html5 /css practice. Initially i never thought i could code without prior experience and background in programming as well as web development, but my curiosity opened way for me when i searched the web to find out if i could do so. Now i know, i can do it. here's a link to the project https://github.com/kandytox/My_Favourite_Listings.git
